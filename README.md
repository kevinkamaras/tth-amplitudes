Calculator for (tth + n parton) color-ordered amplitudes.

- main.py has explanations and an example of how to obtain an amplitude from a set of momenta and a list of helicities.
- amps.py contains all the functions for the amplitudes, namely
  - tthg
  - tthgg
  - tthqq
  - tthggg
  - tthqqg
  - tthgggg
  - tthqqgg
  - tthqqqq
- any additional subamplitudes can be found in core.py
- main.py also contains some of the tests I ran to check my spinors and amplitudes, which can be uncommented and ran through main.py
